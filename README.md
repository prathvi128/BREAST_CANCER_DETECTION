# BREAST_CANCER_DETECTION
This project implements a deep learning model to classify breast tumors as malignant or benign using neural networks. It utilizes the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset, containing 30 features derived from cell nuclei images.
<br>
The model is a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) designed to predict tumor malignancy based on 569 samples with 30 features. The dataset is preprocessed and split for training and testing. Performance is measured using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
<br>
